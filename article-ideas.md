Your website sounds perfect for a "Quantum Minds" series—a deep dive into how quantum mechanics intersects with consciousness. This transcript from the interview with philosopher Kelvin McQueen (Chapman University) is gold: it covers the measurement problem, major theories, critiques, and testable predictions in an accessible way. McQueen's balanced, clear explanations make it ideal for popular science articles that blend QM foundations, philosophy, and neuroscience.

I've organized 20 article ideas into categories for easy planning. Each includes:

Title: Clickbait-y but substantive.
Angle: Hook, length (short/long), visuals.
Key Transcript Hooks: Direct quotes/ideas to quote.
Why It Works: SEO, reader appeal, extensions.

Use stunning visuals: Quantum wavefunctions collapsing, multiverse branches, microtubule diagrams, brain scans. Monetize: Affiliate links to books (Penrose's Emperor's New Mind, Chalmers), QM courses.
1. Primer Articles (Build Audience – Short, 1500 words)





























TitleAngleKey Transcript HooksWhy It WorksWhy Quantum Mechanics Might Explain Your ThoughtsElevator pitch: Hard problem → Classical fails → Quantum superposition/entanglement. Infographic: Neuron network vs. quantum weirdness."How could billions of neurons give rise to the reddishness of red?"; Classical physics "runs out at a certain scale."Hooks curious readers; SEO: "quantum consciousness explained." Series entry point.The Measurement Problem: Where Quantum Weirdness Meets RealityAnimate Von Neumann chain: Particle → Device → Brain → Collapse?"Superposition magnifies up... brain in superposition of experiencing A or B."Core QM topic; ties to Schrödinger's Cat. Viral potential.Wigner's Friend Paradox: Two Realities, One LabThought experiment comic: Inside/outside box views clash."Friend sees definite outcome; Wigner sees superposition."Mind-bending; great for Twitter threads/X posts.
