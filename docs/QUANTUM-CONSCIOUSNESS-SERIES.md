## Content Quality Standards

### Each Article Must Include:
1. **Hook**: Compelling opening that grabs attention
2. **Expert Quotes**: Direct quotes from McQueen transcript
3. **Clear Explanations**: Accessible but substantive
4. **Visual Aids**: Diagrams, animations, or infographics
5. **Real Examples**: Concrete illustrations of abstract concepts
6. **Why It Matters**: Connection to broader themes
7. **Takeaway**: Memorable conclusion or insight
8. **Call to Action**: Related articles, newsletter, or discussion

### Writing Guidelines
- **Tone**: Accessible but authoritative (not dumbed down)
- **Voice**: Engaging, curious, balanced (not pushy about any theory)
- **Technical Level**: College-educated general audience
- **Length**: Strict adherence to word counts (quality over padding)

## Tracking Progress

All articles are tracked in `/lib/articles.ts`. Each article has:
- Status: `planned` → `outlined` → `draft` → `published`
- Priority: 1 (highest) to 3 (lower)
- Estimated writing time
- Related paradoxes for internal linking

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review article data structure in `/lib/articles.ts`
2. **This Week**: Write series introduction article (#0)
3. **This Month**: Complete first 3 primer articles
4. **Ongoing**: Track progress, adjust timeline as needed

**Note**: This series aligns perfectly with the site's focus on paradoxes and quantum mechanics. Articles should naturally link to existing paradox pages (especially Schrödinger's Cat) and can introduce products like posters, books, or courses at natural transition points.
