I completely rewrote the strategy around your new vision. Here's what changed:

**The Core Shift:**
- **Before:** E-commerce store that happens to have content
- **After:** Free exploration platform that happens to have a shop

**Key Differences:**

1. **95/5 Model**: 95% of visitors never buy (and that's perfect). The 5% who do are supporting something they already love—like Kurzgesagt or Wait But Why.

2. **Three-Layer Architecture**:
   - Layer 1: Free exploration hub (paradox library, daily curiosity, interactive tools)
   - Layer 2: Retention mechanics (weekly puzzles, progress tracking, community)
   - Layer 3: Embedded shop (products emerge naturally from content)

3. **Habit Formation Focus**: Daily email, weekly puzzles, progress badges—designed to make people *return* before they ever *buy*.

4. **Content-First Revenue**: Products appear as "if you loved this explainer, here's a poster of it"—not as the main event.

**Why This Works Better:**

- **Lower pressure**: You're not begging people to buy; you're inviting them to support
- **Better retention**: Free daily value creates habit (email subscribers = real audience)
- **Higher trust**: Giving freely proves you're not just in it for money
- **Sustainable**: Even with 0 sales, you're building something valuable

**The Unfair Advantage:**
No one else is doing "beautifully designed, free science exploration with Tbilisi soul." You'd be the only one in that niche.

The plan now includes a literal 48-hour starting point and emphasizes this is worth building even if it makes $0 (portfolio, skills, community).

## Payment Processor Options for Georgian Individual Entrepreneurs

Since Stripe doesn't support Georgia, here are the verified options for processing payments:

### #1 - FanBasis (RECOMMENDED PRIMARY)
- **Features**: Full Stripe-like functionality (one-click upsells, payment links, recurring subscriptions, dispute management)
- **Fees**: ~4.1% including withdrawal
- **Pros**: 
  - Accepts Georgian Individual Entrepreneurs (even new ones)
  - Personal onboarding + Slack support channel
  - Native Zapier integration
  - Good mobile app
  - Easy funnel integration (no coding required for basic setup)
- **Cons**: Slightly higher fees than Stripe
- **Best for**: Primary payment processor for digital products, subscriptions, and funnels

### #2 - PayPal Business (BACKUP)
- **Features**: Invoicing and recurring payment links
- **Fees**: Higher fees than FanBasis
- **Pros**: Widely recognized, works with Georgian businesses
- **Cons**: 
  - Can't charge customer cards on file
  - Poor funnel integration (no one-click upsells)
  - Higher fees
- **Best for**: High-ticket one-time payments, backup option

### #3 - Payoneer (BACKUP)
- **Features**: Payment processing and withdrawal to Georgian banks
- **Fees**: 2.9% + 3% withdrawal fee = ~6% total (expensive!)
- **Pros**: Smooth withdrawal process (1-2 days to Georgian bank account)
- **Cons**: Very high total fees (6% is excessive)
- **Best for**: Last resort backup option only

### #4 - Lemon Squeezy (LIKELY NOT AVAILABLE)
- **Features**: Digital products, subscriptions, automated tax compliance, analytics, merchant of record
- **Status**: **⚠️ PROBABLY NOT AVAILABLE** - Acquired by Stripe in July 2024
- **Fees**: 5% + $0.50 per transaction (plus +1.5% international, +1.5% PayPal, +0.5% subscriptions)
- **Why Likely Not Available**: 
  - Since Stripe acquired Lemon Squeezy, they likely inherited Stripe's country restrictions
  - Reports of increased scrutiny in store approvals post-acquisition
  - All transactions in USD (converted from other currencies)
- **Action**: Still worth contacting support, but expect rejection due to Stripe ownership
- **Verdict**: Even if available, fees are HIGHER than FanBasis (5%+ vs 4.1%), so not recommended

### Recommended Setup:
- **Primary**: FanBasis (best balance of features, fees, and support)
- **Backups**: PayPal Business + Payoneer (for redundancy and customer preference)
- **Skip**: Lemon Squeezy (Stripe-owned, likely restricted, higher fees anyway)

### Implementation Action Items:
1. ✅ **Set up FanBasis account** (apply as Georgian Individual Entrepreneur)
2. ✅ **Set up PayPal Business account** (backup)
3. ✅ **Set up Payoneer account** (last resort backup)
4. ⏳ **Integrate FanBasis into shop** (payment links, recurring subscriptions)
5. ⏳ **Test payment flow** with small test transactions
6. ⏳ **Configure Zapier integration** for automation if needed
7. ⏳ **Document payment process** for customers (what to expect)

### Local Georgian Options (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Keepz and other local processors accept Georgian IEs but:
  - No user-friendly dashboard for payment links
  - No recurring subscriptions (manual process)
  - Requires IT specialist for API integration
  - Some only allow GEL payment links (deters international customers)
